# Data Visualization Project ðŸ“Š

## Overview

The **Data Visualization Project** is a modern web application designed to allow users to visualize data through different graph types such as bar graphs, line graphs with trend lines, and scatter plots. The platform supports file uploads (CSV/JSON), manual data entry, and offers interactive graph features for real-time updates, zooming, and panning. It also supports downloading graphs as PNG/JPEG files and exporting data in CSV format.

- **File Upload**: Upload CSV/JSON files.
- **Graph Display**: Display dynamic graphs using Chart.js, D3.js, or Plotly.js.
- **Interactive Features**:
  - Real-time updates for graph changes.
  - Hover tooltips for displaying exact values.
  - Series toggle visibility.
  - Graph zooming and panning.
- **Graph Types**:
  - Bar Graph.
  - Line Graph with trend lines.
  - Scatter Plot.
- **Export Functionality**:
  - Download graphs as PNG/JPEG.
  - Export data as CSV.

### **Backend:**
- **Server**: Node.js (Express) or Python (Flask/Django) for handling requests.
- **API Endpoints**:
  - `/upload`: Handle file uploads.
  - `/process`: Process uploaded or manually entered data.
  - `/generate-graph`: Return graph parameters for rendering.
- **Graph Generation**: Server-side graph rendering using Matplotlib (Python) or Chart.js (Node.js).
- **Data Handling**: Parse and transform uploaded CSV/JSON data into suitable JSON structures.
- **Database** (Optional): MongoDB/PostgreSQL for storing data and graphs.

### **Trend Line Calculation**:
- **Linear Regression**: Calculate and display trend lines using libraries like NumPy and SciPy (Python) or TensorFlow.js (Node.js).

### **Styling and Themes**:
- Switch between themes like dark mode and customize graph styles (colors, line widths, markers).

### **Frontend Frameworks (Optional)**:
- Use React.js/Vue.js for building a dynamic SPA.
- Implement state management for handling multiple graphs.
